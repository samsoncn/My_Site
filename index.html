                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p>One of the proudest projects I worked on was happened during this summer internship. It is a web photo editor for AI PoseRecognition model and I got to modify it to have more functionality as well as adjustments of the data outputs. It is not really a big project, but it stands as an important bridge for the data collection.My name is Samson and I am from Hong Kong. I have been away from home since last summer since I am currently attending univeristy in Canada. Honestly, Canada is real damn cold, although I like snowing, melting snow is really disgusting. If you are traveling to Canada during Winter, make sure you bring enough winter jacket with a legit snow boots.</p>
                <!--p>I learned so much from playing and modifying with it, such as programming in python and java, and understanding of Coco dataset with data analysis skills. I also used Android Studio to modify an app for gesture detection testing. The purpose of the project is to allow users to upload and edit images, then the input function would convert information to a dataset for the AI model tuning and the final project, which is a fitness mirror that detect to do gestures. </!--p>
                <p>At the end of the project, I got a chance to teach a cooperation team to use the project to collect data. I was very glad that people were using my tools and I got to introduce my tool to them as I also learned what user experience is and I could do adjustments from feedback. This is one of the projects that I am very proud of.</p>
                <p>A basic paragraph structure usually consists of five sentences: the topic sentence, three supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. But the secrets to paragraph writing lay in four essential elements, which when used correctly, can make a okay paragraph into a great paragraph.

                    Element #1: Unity. Unity in a paragraph begins with the topic sentence. Every paragraph has one single, controlling idea that is expressed in its topic sentence, which is typically the first sentence of the paragraph. A paragraph is unified around this main idea, with the supporting sentences providing detail and discussion. In order to write a good topic sentence, think about your theme and all the points you want to make. Decide which point drives the rest, and then write it as your topic sentence.
                    Element #2: Order. Order refers to the way you organize your supporting sentences. Whether you choose chronological order, order of importance, or another logical presentation of detail, a solid paragraph always has a definite organization. In a well-ordered paragraph, the reader follows along easily, aided by the pattern youâ€™ve established. Order helps the reader grasp your meaning and avoid confusion.
                    Element #3: Coherence. Coherence is the quality that makes your writing understandable. Sentences within a paragraph need to connect to each other and work together as a whole. One of the best ways to achieve coherency is to use transition words. These words create bridges from one sentence to the next. You can use transition words that show order (first, second, third); spatial relationships (above, below) or logic (furthermore, in addition, in fact). Also, in writing a paragraph, using a consistent verb tense and point of view are important ingredients for coherency.
                    Element #4: Completeness. Completeness means a paragraph is well-developed. If all sentences clearly and sufficiently support the main idea, then your paragraph is complete. If there are not enough sentences or enough information to prove your thesis, then the paragraph is incomplete. Usually three supporting sentences, in addition to a topic sentence and concluding sentence, are needed for a paragraph to be complete. The concluding sentence or last sentence of the paragraph should summarize your main idea by reinforcing your topic sentence.</p-->
